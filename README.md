# Mobile IoT Network Protocol

Welcome to the repository for my undergraduate research project on building an open-source network protocol for mobile IoT devices. This project aimed to develop a custom network protocol for communication between mobile IoT devices using a Raspberry Pi car kit. The project implements a publisher-subscriber architecture and defines various network message types for commands, errors, information, and more.
